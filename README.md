# shadow lang

this project had fallen into inactivity and recently i've been wanting to get started with it again.

but, i've been coming up with so many interesting ideas for things to play around with that i figured it's 
probably easiest to have a clean start. also, i want to capture some footage and document a little more, so we'll see how that goes!

i'm not sure how much code i'll be able to salvage, so here's a blank branch for my design notes.
scrappy for now, but i'll try solidify them some and get to implementing.

check back in later, or something!
