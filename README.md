# shadow lang

this project had fallen into inactivity and recently i've been wanting to get started with it again.

but, i've been coming up with so many interesting ideas for things to play around with that i figured it's 
probably easiest to have a clean start. also, i want to capture some footage and document a little more, so we'll see how that goes!

the language design notes are present in `design.txt`.

i'll write a proper README at some point (maybe)
